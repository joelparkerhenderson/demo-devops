## Hostnames


### For the general public

Create these hostnames:

  * "www.example.com" for the typical public website.
  
  * "app.example.com" for the typical public application.


### For devops

Create these hostnames:

  * "uat.example.com" for user acceptance testing of the application.

  * "seer.example.com" for monitoring, alerting, analytics, etc.


## Email addresses


### For officers

Create these email addresses:

  * “co@example.com” which means Commanding Officer.

  * “xo@example.com” which means Executive Officer.

When you sign up for various services, try to use the email addresses like this:

 * Use the email address “co@examaple.com” for any highest-level areas, such as the organization's main account, or root-equivalent security, etc.

 * Use the email address “xo@example.com” for anything that you can delegate, such as for a billing contact, administrative contact, technical contact, newsletter contact, etc. 

We recommend these addresses because these tend to be better than using any person-specific email address:

  * These addresses are typically easy to assign to different people in the organization, or to multiple people, or to an email list.

  * These addresses are especially well-known and also short, which makes them easy and effective for staff to recognize and use.


### For systems administrators

Create these email addresses:

  * “webmaster@example.com” for website administration, such as for web vistors reporting issues.

  * “postmaster@example.com” for email administration, such as for bounced messages.

  * "abuse@example.com" for any problem mail, such as for email spam alerting.

  * "security@example.com" for any security mail, such as for coordinated disclosure.

It is important to handle these addresses carefully and at least daily, because these addresses are important for urgent issue reports.

Be aware that these adresses may receive a lot of spam, because these email addresses are well known.

The systems administrators may want to add specialized capabilities to these addreses, such as creating an email address PGP key to enable secure email communication.


### For devops

Create these email addresses:

  * “deployer@example.com” for continuous deployment automation.
